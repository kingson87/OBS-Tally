### ðŸ”§ IMPLEMENTED CODE CHANGES:

1. **Brightness Control Function:**
   ```cpp

       DEBUG_PORT.println("Brightness set to: " + String(brightness));
   }
   ```

2. **Display Persistence Fix:**
   ```cpp
   // Update display if state changed OR every 2 seconds to maintain persistence
   if (stateChanged || (millis() - lastDisplayUpdate > 2000)) {
       updateDisplay();
       lastDisplayUpdate = millis();
   }
   ```

3. **Brightness Integration in updateDisplay():**
   ```cpp
   // Set brightness based on status
   if (deviceState.isProgram) {
       brightness = BRIGHTNESS_LIVE;    // 200
   } else if (deviceState.isPreview) {
       brightness = BRIGHTNESS_PREVIEW; // 150
   } else {
       brightness = BRIGHTNESS_IDLE;    // 100
   }
   setBrightness(brightness);
   ```
